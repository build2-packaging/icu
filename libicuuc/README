International Components for Unicode (ICU) is a set of cross-platform Unicode-
based globalization libraries with libicuuc C/C++ library providing core
Unicode support and basic functionality (character properties, locales, etc)
and libicudata C library providing data for libicuuc and libicui18n (locale
data, etc). For more information see:

http://site.icu-project.org/

This package contains the original libicuuc and libicudata libraries source
code overlaid with the build2-based build system and packaged for the build2
package manager (bpkg).

See the INSTALL file for the prerequisites and installation instructions.

Send questions, bug reports, or any other feedback about library itself to the
ICU mailing lists. Send build system and packaging-related feedback to the
packaging@build2.org mailing list (see https://lists.build2.org for posting
guidelines, etc).

The packaging of libicuuc and libicudata for build2 is tracked in a Git
repository at:

https://git.build2.org/cgit/packaging/icu/
