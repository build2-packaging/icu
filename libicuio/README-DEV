This document describes how libicuio was packaged for build2. In particular,
this understanding will be useful when upgrading to a new upstream version.
See ../README-DEV for general notes on ICU packaging.

Symlink the required upstream directories into libicuio/:

$ ln -s ../../upstream/icu4c/source/io libicuio
