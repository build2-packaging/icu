This document describes how libicui18n was packaged for build2. In particular,
this understanding will be useful when upgrading to a new upstream version.
See ../README-DEV for general notes on ICU packaging.

Symlink the required upstream directories into libicui18n/:

$ ln -s ../../upstream/icu4c/source/i18n libicui18n
